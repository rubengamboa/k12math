    Approach
      Lead with questions and what answers look like
      Use AI to generate problems, but not much else
    Big Ideas
      Numbers come in many forms
      Numbers should always have units

            Always give units, e.g., oranges, hands
          Recognize numbers to 20
            This should be about reading/writing numbers
          Compare quantities
            Can these quantities be compared? E.g., money and length
            More of this or that?
            Arrange items in order
          Basic addition and subtraction with objects
